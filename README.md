# EuroBioc2017-MSnbase

This repository contains material (slides/org-mode presentation) for the flash
light talk covering recent updates to `mzR`, `MSnbase` and `xmcs`
(i.e. on-the-fly data access and MS data write support) to be presented at the
European Bioconductor Developer Meeting 2017 in Cambridge, UK (see
https://github.com/Bioconductor/EuroBioc2017 for details).

The title for the talk is **Enabling analysis of large scale
metabolomics/proteomics data: on-the-fly data access in MSnbase**. The topics
covered in the talk are:
- Basics for LCMS data.
- `onDisk` *vs* `inMem`: why?
- `mzR` write support.
- Application example: MS data centroiding in `R`:
  - Profile-mode for a test peak.
  - Apply `smooth` and `pickPeaks`.
  - Show results and compare to proteowizard.
